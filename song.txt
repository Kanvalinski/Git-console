I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday its so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say its wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep
When I wrote this,
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breath new life in me
I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me it'll enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon' hug me
But I'm out of options there's nothing else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
